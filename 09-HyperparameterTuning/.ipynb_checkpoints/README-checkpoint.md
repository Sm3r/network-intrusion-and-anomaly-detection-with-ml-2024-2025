# Hyperparameter tuning and regularization
In these notebooks, we will explore two common methods for tuning the hyperparameters of an ML model, namely *grid search* and *random search*. In the sample code, we will use these methods to find the best configuration of a [Random Forest](./hyperparameter-tuning-RF.ipynb) for network traffic classification. 
We will also see [regularization](./Regularisation.ipynb) methods for mitigating the issue of overfitting the training data.

In the laboratory on [hyperparameter tuning](./hyperparameter-tuning-lab.ipynb), you will tune the hyperparameters of an MLP model for binary network traffic classification. You will implement Grid and Random search methods to tune the MLP model on a dataset of benign traffic and DDoS attack traffic.

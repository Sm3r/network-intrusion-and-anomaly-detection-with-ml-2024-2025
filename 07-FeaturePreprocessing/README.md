# Network traffic feature extraction with Pyshark and Scapy
In these notebooks, we will learn how to use the Bag-of-Words technique to convert text data into numerical vectors that machine learning algorithms can understand. You can practice BoW and  other feature preprocessing techniques with the notebook [FeatureExtractionPreprocessing](./FeatureExtractionPreprocessing.ipynb). 

Finally, we will learn how to use PCA to visualise the network flow samples in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional spaces. To do so, we will reduce the dimension of the data points from 21 features (see the flow representation below) to 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

We will use a sample dataset of benign and various DDoS attacks from the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html).
The network traffic has been previously pre-processed in a way that packets are grouped in bi-directional traffic flows using the 5-tuple (source IP, destination IP, source Port, destination Port, protocol). Each flow is represented with 21 packet-header features computed from max 10 packets:
